This repository is a clone of dxuglas/pushback-8757b, modified for refrence in my L3 DTSD Project.

Source code is this repository WILL NOT COMPILE, as it is missing key dependencies (PROS) and a lot device management code written by me. 

It ONLY contains the code for the odometry tracking system itself, to help make it clear to anyone marking what code is included in the scope of my project, and to prevent them from having to explore deeply nested directories to ensure they have found all of my code. However it WILL NOT WORK in isolation as it is here. To better understand the systems real world implementations,
refer to the repository referenced above.
